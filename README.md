# JEMS-PHP-SRePS

The purpose of the PHP-SRePS project is to plan, design, build, and implement a software application to aid in the decision-making of product orders for the People Health Pharmacy. 

The software will provide a user-friendly GUI to facilitate entering stock and sales records. The PHP SRepS software aims to analyse trends in past sales data and determine predictions for product demand, to then be compiled into reports detailing a summary of sales reports and forecasts. These reports are to be represented in graphical form with the use of charts and graphs. To keep with global standards all generated reports need to be able to be converted to CSV files. 

The software must also be able to give notifications/alerts for products when stocks are running low in order to always have all items in stock.
